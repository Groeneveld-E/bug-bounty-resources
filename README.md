# bugbounty resources
Resources I consider useful for security research of web applications.
It will not contain an index based on bug types as there is an excellent reference list made by [ngalongc](https://github.com/ngalongc/bug-bounty-reference).
What it will contain is a list of resources ordered both by type of medium and by security researcher.
Also there will be some miscellaneous lists like antivirus resources and cyber security firm resources.
You are welcome to submit pull requests.
