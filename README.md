# Bug bounty resources
This repository contains resources I consider useful for security research of web applications.
The reason for making this repository is the following quote by [James Kettle](https://portswigger.net/blog/so-you-want-to-be-a-web-security-researcher):
> Every time you read a good quality blog post, read the entire archive.

Therefore if I find quality content from a security researcher I try to find additional sources from the same author.
The repository will not contain an index based on bug types as there is an excellent reference list made by [ngalongc](https://github.com/ngalongc/bug-bounty-reference).
What it will contain is a list of resources ordered both by type of medium and by security researcher.
Also there will be some miscellaneous lists like antivirus resources and cyber security firm resources.
You are welcome to submit pull requests.
