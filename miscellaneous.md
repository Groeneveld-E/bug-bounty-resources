## Sources ordered by subject
This source file contains an eclectic collection of sources. Some sources are not directly related to security research of web applications. 
However, I believe if you pay close attention there are some ideas to be found in these sources which can make you a better researcher.
Allowing yourself some cross-pollination from other areas like game hacking or investigative journalism possibly give fresh ideas
to sharpen your web app hacking skills. For example, there is an excellent video series about game hacking made by [LiveOverflow](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhixgUqwRTjzzBeFSHXrw9DnQtssdAwgG). It is both highly entertaining en teaching how to reverse engineer a game. He shows methods and skills I believe I will be able to use later on. Therefore I decided to include these kind of sources in this file.
