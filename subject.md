## Sources ordered by subject
This source file contains an eclectic collection of sources. Certain sources are not directly related to security research of web applications. 
However, I believe if you pay close attention there are some ideas to be found in these sources which can make you a better researcher.
Allowing yourself some cross-pollination from other areas like game hacking or investigative journalism possibly give fresh ideas
to sharpen your web app hacking skills. Therefore I decided to include these kind of sources in this file.
